## Windows Live Writer 2010 Twitter and Bitly Plugin

###Description
The Twitter and Bitly plugin for Windows Live Writer is a plugin that triggers when you publish a blog post in Windows Live Writer. Upon trigger, the plugin calls out to Bitly.com to convert your postâ€™s URL into a short form.  It then uses a user-defined tweet template to generate a tweet that is then displayed in a preview window.  You can make edits to the tweet prior to posting or post to Twitter as-is.
